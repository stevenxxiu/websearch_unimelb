	title = {Five Balltree Construction Algorithms},
	abstract = {Abstract. Balltrees are simple geometric data structures with a wide range of practical applications to geometric learning tasks. In this report we compare 5 different algorithms for constructing balltrees from data. We study the trade-off between construction time and the quality of the constructed tree. Two of the algorithms are on-line, two construct the structures from the data set in a top down fashion, and one uses a bottom up approach. We empirically study the algorithms on random data drawn from eight different probability distributions representing smooth, clustered, and curve distributed data in different ambient space dimensions. We find that the bottom up approach usually produces the best trees but has the longest construction time. The other approaches have uses in specific circumstances. 1},

	abstract = {The nearest neighbor ({NN}) technique is very simple, highly efficient and effective in the field of pattern recognition, text categorization, object recognition etc. Its simplicity is its main advantage, but the disadvantages can't be ignored even. The memory requirement and computation complexity also matter. Many techniques are developed to overcome these limitations. {NN} techniques are broadly classified into structure less and structure based techniques. In this paper, we present the survey of such techniques. Weighted {kNN}, Model based {kNN}, Condensed {NN}, Reduced {NN}, Generalized {NN} are structure less techniques whereas k-d tree, ball tree, Principal Axis Tree, Nearest Feature Line, Tunable {NN}, Orthogonal Search Tree are structure based algorithms developed on the basis of {kNN}. The structure less method overcome memory limitation and structure based techniques reduce the computational complexity.},
