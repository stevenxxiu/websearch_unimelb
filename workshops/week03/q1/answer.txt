p@k user model:
	User Actions:
		The user visits the first page of the search results, with a listing of k results.
		The user arbitrarily picks a document, and is satisfied when the result is relavant.

	The probability of the user being satisfied is then |R_{k,q}|/k, where R_{k,q} is the set of relevant documents for the first k results.
